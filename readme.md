This's my fork.

JavaScript becoming a useful language that I love to learn and play around with.

This's also a useful reference as well.

Ok, I'm done with the percentages of how far I've done.

This repository is not going to have activity on it for periods of time.

(At least, I have new BFDIA episodes to look forwarded to now.)
